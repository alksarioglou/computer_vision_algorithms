# Image Analysis and Computer Vision Algorithms
Simulation of Downsampling, Harris Corner Detector, Canny Edge Detector, Triangulation, Stereo Reconstruction and Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks using **Python**

## Project_1
- (1_sample.ipynb) -> Exploring the properties of **spatial sampling** by considering an already sampled input image and resampling it with a lower sampling rate (downsamling / decimation).
- (1_harris.ipynb) -> Implementing a **Harris corner detector** to extract corners of an image used as features for machine learning algorithms.
- (1_canny.ipynb) -> Coding a **Canny edge detector in 2D** to extract edges of an images as useful features.

## Project_2
- (2_stereo.ipynb) -> Computing a **3D reconstruction** of a given image pair by first finding corresponding points in the two images, then performing triangulation to recover the 3D world coordinates and finally implementing the stereo reconstruction of the scene.
